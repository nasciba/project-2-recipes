      instructions: "Combine corn, tomatoes, avocado, salt and pepper in a large bowl and toss to coat. Add in the juice of one lime and the olive oil and toss. Top with crumbled blue cheese and basil ribbons and toss once more. Serve immediately.Even with the avocado, this stays good in the fridge for a day or two - just press a piece of plastic wrap tightly against the salt and refrigerate. If you're my husband, this stays good in the fridge for 4 or 5 days. Oomph.",
